You must decide how you will switch between each fileâ€™s data and display it.

You must use JSON.NET (provided in .sln) to read in each JSON file.

No additional libraries should be used except what is provided in the solution.

Add or alter the code as you deem necessary with any additional functionality or commands

Send back a zipped file with all source code and a .sln file before your scheduled technical interview for review.  

Evaluation Criteria:
Your program must run and at minimum use the commands above

We are not concerned about pretty printing the outputs (opt to spend less time on formatting and more on functionality)

Expect to be questioned on your design choices
